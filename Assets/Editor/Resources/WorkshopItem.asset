  Title: Souvenir
  Description: "This module asks you questions about some of the other modules on
    your bomb after you\u2019ve solved them. It requires you to remember or write
    down things that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be significant.\r\n\r\nThis module is
    not currently in active development. If you wish to see the module developed further,
    please leave a comment and/or send me a message. You can also contribute development
    by submitting pull requests to the [url=https://github.com/Timwi/KtaneSouvenir]source
    code[/url]. If you wish to take over development/maintenance entirely, that could
    be arranged too.\r\n\r\nSome of the things this module might ask you about (not
    a complete list):\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]3D Maze:[/b] floor markings, cardinal direction\r\n[*][b]Adventure
    Game:[/b] your stats before you took a potion; which correct item you used first/second/etc.;
    which wrong item gave you a strike\r\n[*][b]Bitmaps:[/b] How many white/black
    squares were in each quadrant\r\n[*][b]Connection Check:[/b] What was the initial
    red/green state of the buttons at the start, or when you get a strike\r\n[*][b]Hexamaze:[/b]
    pawn color\r\n[*][b]Listening:[/b] correct and wrong code(s) you entered\r\n[*][b]Monsplode:[/b]
    creatures displayed and moves shown on buttons\r\n[*][b]Mouse in the Maze:[/b]
    color of the torus and the solution sphere\r\n[*][b]Simon States:[/b] which colors
    flashed\r\n[*][b]The Bulb:[/b] which buttons you pressed (including wrong ones)\r\n[*][b]Two
    Bits:[/b] query responses\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nAdditions that would be welcome would
    have to satisfy the following guidelines:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]No questions about
    things that can just be read off after the module was solved (e.g. the symbols
    in Astrology)\r\n[*]No questions about things that can be re-deduced by re-solving
    the module (e.g. offset in Caesar Cipher)\r\n[*]Definitely no questions that could
    under any circumstances be impossible to answer\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Souvenir.pdf]Manual
