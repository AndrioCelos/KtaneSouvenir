  Title: Souvenir
  Description: "This module asks you questions about some of the other modules on
    your bomb after you\u2019ve solved them. It requires you to remember or write
    down things that otherwise wouldn\u2019t be significant.\r\n\r\r\nSome of the
    things this module might ask you about are listed below. For a complete list,
    please see the manual.\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]3D Maze:[/b] floor markings, cardinal
    direction\r\n[*][b]Adventure Game:[/b] your stats before you took a potion\n[*][b]Bitmaps:[/b]
    How many white/black squares were in each quadrant\r\n[*][b]Connection Check:[/b]
    What was the initial red/green state of the buttons at the start\n[*][b]Hexamaze:[/b]
    pawn color\r\n[*][b]Monsplode:[/b] creatures displayed and moves shown on buttons\r\n[*][b]Mouse
    in the Maze:[/b] color of the torus and the solution sphere\r\n[*][b]Simon States:[/b]
    which colors flashed\r\n[*][b]The Bulb:[/b] which buttons you pressed (including
    wrong ones)\r\n[*][b]Two Bits:[/b] query responses\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nIf you wish
    to see another module added, please leave a comment and/or send me a message.
    You can also contribute development by submitting pull requests to the [url=https://github.com/Timwi/KtaneSouvenir]source
    code[/url]. Additions that would be welcome would have to satisfy the following
    guidelines:\r\n\r\n[list]\r\n[*]No questions about things that can just be read
    off after the module was solved (e.g. the symbols in Astrology)\r\n[*]No questions
    about things that can be re-deduced by re-solving the module (e.g. offset in Caesar
    Cipher)\r\n[*]Definitely no questions that could under any circumstances be impossible
    to answer\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[url=http://ktane.timwi.de/PDF/Souvenir.pdf]Manual
